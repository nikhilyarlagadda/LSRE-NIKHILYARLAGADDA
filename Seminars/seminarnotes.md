•	Boston Matrix
It is known as B-Box, BCG Analysis, Growth-share matrix and the portfolio diagram. It helps to identify high-growth prospects by categorizing the company’s product according to the growth rate and market share i.e. (it helps the organization to decide how to allocate the resources for the product or service it sells depending upon the position of the product or service in the market).It is mainly used by the people responsible for brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis.
The Boston matrix includes two axis (market share and market growth) that split between high and low. It forms a 2x2 matrix which consists of 4 cells in which each cell is allocated to a category. Categories in the Boston matrix are 
•	Question marks
•	Stars
•	Cash cows
•	Dogs

 
Based on the market share and market growth, products are placed among the four categories. Most organizations expect that their product life cycle starts from the question mark. Some products also begin from the star category. As the market keeps on growing the product, also changes from the question mark to star and then to cash cow and it finally enters into the dogs category when the market for the product is declined.
Question marks:
It is also known as the problem child. It has a low market share in the fast growing market. The revenue obtained from this category is very less and it is not enough to keep up with the rapid growth which in turn needs to invest more money to gain the market share. This category consumes more money.
Identifying the question marks with the potential to gain market share from all of them are very difficult. Careful analysis should be taken during identifying the question marks and investment should be spent on these question marks which replaces the existing market in the future. These question marks with stable market share are moved into the star. The question marks without stable market share even after investing on them lead to the dogs.
Stars: 
It has high market growth and high market share. The revenue obtained in this almost equal or high than the invested amount. Products with highest market share are moved into the cash cows when the market reaches its maturity level. The remaining products that are not capable to build market share move into Dogs category.
Cash cows: 
These are the low growth products with high market share. Successful products in mature markets are known as cows. These products are managed to earn the profits. The earnings obtained in this category are more than the invested amount. These investments should be utilized either in star or in the question marks category which builds the question marks into leaders. 
Dogs: 
This category is considered as the end of the product life cycle where it can be terminated if market declines or continued based on the situation. It belongs to low market share and low market growth. The revenue obtained from these is very less and just enough to keep its low market share. According to the organizational perspective spending resources for this category is a waste they can be used either in the question marks or in the star. Management needs to judge whether to continue or withdraw the product in/from the market.
Advantages:	
•	Provides a base for the management to decide and prepare for future actions.
•	It is very simple to use, as there are only two dimensions and four quadrants.
Disadvantages:
•	It splits the businesses two parts namely high and low. But whereas businesses can be medium also. Thus the true nature of the business does not reflected.
•	At times, dogs may help other businesses in gaining competitive advantage. They can earn even more than cash cows sometimes.
