1. What is large scale requirements engineering?
According to author[1] the goal of the market driven process (MDRE) is to deliver the right product at the right time to the targeted market. The success of the product mainly depends upon the response of the market. There is need to assess the market situation continuously by researching market needs, collecting all possible feedback from the market and also by identifying the competitor’s status. This information helps in creating a constant flow of new requirements and ideas which lead to increase in size of the requirements for a product. As a result, the size and the complexity of the requirements database grow even faster than the size of the software product that is to be carried out. This situation is termed as large-scale requirements engineering or even large scale requirements engineering.	

2. What are the challenges in large scale requirements engineering?
	According to the authors[2],[3] the challenges faced in the large scale requirements engineering are mainly due to:
•	More customer requirements
•	Customer requirements management
•	Limited formal interface to customer
•	Technology change
•	Distributed teams
•	Traceability
•	Scope change and creep
•	Resource fluctuation

3. What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are discussing?
	According to the authors[4] the order of magnitude of the number of requirements is divided into four categories based on the number of requirements (size) used by an organization for developing the software-intensive systems. The requirements are categorized as follows:
•	Small-Scale Requirements Engineering		~10	   requirements
•	Medium-Scale Requirements Engineering		~100	   requirements
•	Large-Scale Requirements Engineering		~1,000	   requirements
•	Very Large-Scale Requirements Engineering	~10,000  requirements

<h5>Seminar 1:Home work</h5>
 -  What is Gap analysis?
    -  It mainly helps in finding the gap between current state and the future desired state. It contains a list of characteristic factors (attributes, competencies, performance levels) of the present situation and a list of factors need to achieve the future objectives which help in identifying the gap that need to be fulfilled.
 -  What is CVA analysis?
    -It is a technique used to measure and grow relative market price.It helps how to measure the components of customer value (market-perceived quality and market-perceived price) and plots a map that shows how the quality offered by each competitor, in any given marketplace, compares to the price it charges. The map also shows the marketplace competitors and compares their quality/price positions.
 -  What is IVA analysis ?
    -  It is defined as a technique in which the ongoing product status is compared with the predefined product stratagies and checks whether the product is in line or not by considering the limited resources such as cost,time, risk and knowledge[1].
 - What are the tools available for continuous integration?
   - <p>It is a development practice in which the code integrated by the developers is checked by an automated build .It helps in identifying the problems early in the code. Some of the Tools available for the continuous integration are </p>

<h5>Seminar 2: Homework</h5>
   - what is Boston Matrix?
      - It is known as B-Box, BCG Analysis, Growth-share matrix and the portfolio diagram. It helps to identify high-growth prospects by categorizing the company’s product according to the growth rate and market share i.e. (it helps the organization to decide how to allocate the resources for the product or service it sells depending upon the position of the product or service in the market).It is mainly used by the people responsible for brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis.
      - The Boston matrix[1] includes two axis (market share and market growth) that split between high and low. It forms a 2x2 matrix which consists of 4 cells in which each cell is allocated to a category. Categories in the Boston matrix are 
•	Question marks
•	Stars
•	Cash cows
•	Dogs

    <pre> Market Growth		               	Market Share			Category
             High			     		Low		     Question marks
             High			    		High			  Stars
             Low				      	High			Cash Cows
             Low				      	Low		           Dogs
      </pre>
     - Based on the market share and market growth, products are placed among the four categories. Most organizations expect that their product life cycle starts from the question mark. Some products also begin from the star category. As the market keeps on growing the product, also changes from the question mark to star and then to cash cow and it finally enters into the dogs category when the market for the product is declined.
     - Question marks:
       - It is also known as the problem child. It has a low market share in the fast growing market. The revenue obtained from this category is very less and it is not enough to keep up with the rapid growth which in turn needs to invest more money to gain the market share. This category consumes more money.
Identifying the question marks with the potential to gain market share from all of them are very difficult. Careful analysis should be taken during identifying the question marks and investment should be spent on these question marks which replaces the existing market in the future. These question marks with stable market share are moved into the star. The question marks without stable market share even after investing on them lead to the dogs.
     - Stars: 
       - It has high market growth and high market share. The revenue obtained in this almost equal or high than the invested amount. Products with highest market share are moved into the cash cows when the market reaches its maturity level. The remaining products that are not capable to build market share move into Dogs category.
     - Cash cows: 
       - These are the low growth products with high market share. Successful products in mature markets are known as cows. These products are managed to earn the profits. The earnings obtained in this category are more than the invested amount. These investments should be utilized either in star or in the question marks category which builds the question marks into leaders. 
     - Dogs: 
       - This category is considered as the end of the product life cycle where it can be terminated if market declines or continued based on the situation. It belongs to low market share and low market growth. The revenue obtained from these is very less and just enough to keep its low market share. According to the organizational perspective spending resources for this category is a waste they can be used either in the question marks or in the star. Management needs to judge whether to continue or withdraw the product in/from the market.
    - Advantages:	
•	Provides a base for the management to decide and prepare for future actions.<br>
•	It is very simple to use, as there are only two dimensions and four quadrants.
    - Disadvantages:<br>
•	It splits the businesses two parts namely high and low. But whereas businesses can be medium also. Thus the true nature of the business does not reflected.<br>
•	At times, dogs may help other businesses in gaining competitive advantage. They can earn even more than cash cows sometimes.

     - <h5>Towards a Reference Framework for Software Product Management</h5>
       - The authors of this article mainly focused on developing a reference framework which provides a structure for a body of knowledge for software product management. A clear explanation of how a software product management process is carried out entirely by an organization and the structure of the software product management is not provided clearly. The authors of this article considered this as a gap and developed a reference framework based on an overview of state-of-the-art literature and industrial case studies. This framework clearly explains the step by step process that is carried out by the product managers/organization during the software product management. It also helps in identifying the stakeholders for the company/product and their relation during software product management. 
       - This reference framework divides the software product management into four process area mainly
       	 - Portfolio management: It deals with the products in the product portfolio (no of products a company has).
       	 - Product road mapping: It is used to identify the different releases of a product
       	 - Requirements management: It deals with the content of each individual requirement.
       	 - Product release planning: It deals with the set of requirements that are to be released.
       - In the reference framework, these four processes are carried out as follows:
       - Portfolio management process involves four tasks
         - Partnering and contracting
         - Market trend identification
         - Product life cycle management
         - Product line identification
	 - The input to this process is available from the board, market and partner companies. These inputs help in making the decision about the development strategy and lifecycle. A software product line is identified in this process which serves as an input for product road mapping.
       - Product road mapping process involves these tasks
         - Theme identification
         - Core asset identification
         - Road map construction
         - This process receives input as product lines from portfolio management. This helps in identifying the themes and core assets. This information is collected and mentioned in the road map. This roadmap also acts as an input to the requirements organization.
       - Requirements management process involves these three tasks
         - Requirements gathering
         - Requirements identification
         - Requirements organizing.
         - In this process, input (requirements) obtained from different stakeholders are gathered and identified. Finally, the product requirements are grouped according to the product and core asset.
       - Product release planning mainly involves these five tasks.
         - Requirements prioritization
         - Requirements selection
         - Release definition
         - Release verification
         - Launch application
         - It takes input from the requirements management process where the obtained list of requirements is prioritized and some are selected from the prioritized requirements. A release definition is prepared for the selected requirements and validated by different internal stakeholders and a business case is sent to the board for approval. Once approval is received the implementation process starts and the launch preparation package is delivered to the stakeholders.
       - As this framework also helps in identifying the stakeholders. Some of the stakeholders that are identified and mentioned in this framework are
        - External Stakeholders
           - Market
           - Partner companies
           - Customers
        - Internal stakeholders
           - Development
           - Support
           - Service
           - Research and innovation
           - Sales and marketing
           - Company board
       - This article provides me a clear information and structure of the software product management. The internal processes that are carried out during the software product development and the tasks that are involved in the each process (Road mapping, release planning, requirements management, portfolio management) are clearly understood.

 -  What tools are available for requirements management?
   <p>  Requirements management tools help the organizations in defining and documenting requirements by allowing them to store the requirements in a central location. It helps the team members to find the requirements what is to be developed and the customers access the requirements to check whether the requirements are specified properly or not. It also helps in the process of classification and prioritization of requirements.According to the authors [1], [2], [3] some of the tools used for the requirements management are as follows:</p>
