1. What is large scale requirements engineering?
According to author[1] the goal of the market driven process (MDRE) is to deliver the right product at the right time to the targeted market. The success of the product mainly depends upon the response of the market. There is need to assess the market situation continuously by researching market needs, collecting all possible feedback from the market and also by identifying the competitor’s status. This information helps in creating a constant flow of new requirements and ideas which lead to increase in size of the requirements for a product. As a result, the size and the complexity of the requirements database grow even faster than the size of the software product that is to be carried out. This situation is termed as large-scale requirements engineering or even large scale requirements engineering.	

2. What are the challenges in large scale requirements engineering?
	According to the authors[2],[3] the challenges faced in the large scale requirements engineering are mainly due to:
•	More customer requirements
•	Customer requirements management
•	Limited formal interface to customer
•	Technology change
•	Distributed teams
•	Traceability
•	Scope change and creep
•	Resource fluctuation

3. What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are discussing?
	According to the authors[4] the order of magnitude of the number of requirements is divided into four categories based on the number of requirements (size) used by an organization for developing the software-intensive systems. The requirements are categorized as follows:
•	Small-Scale Requirements Engineering		~10	   requirements
•	Medium-Scale Requirements Engineering		~100	   requirements
•	Large-Scale Requirements Engineering		~1,000	   requirements
•	Very Large-Scale Requirements Engineering	~10,000  requirements

<h5>Seminar 1:Home work</h5>
 -  What is Gap analysis?
    -  It mainly helps in finding the gap between current state and the future desired state. It contains a list of characteristic factors (attributes, competencies, performance levels) of the present situation and a list of factors need to achieve the future objectives which help in identifying the gap that need to be fulfilled.
 -  What is CVA analysis?
    -It is a technique used to measure and grow relative market price.It helps how to measure the components of customer value (market-perceived quality and market-perceived price) and plots a map that shows how the quality offered by each competitor, in any given marketplace, compares to the price it charges. The map also shows the marketplace competitors and compares their quality/price positions.
 -  What is IVA analysis ?
    -  It is defined as a technique in which the ongoing product status is compared with the predefined product stratagies and checks whether the product is in line or not by considering the limited resources such as cost,time, risk and knowledge[1].

<h5>Seminar 2: Homework</h5>

   - what is Boston Matrix?
      - It is known as B-Box, BCG Analysis, Growth-share matrix and the portfolio diagram. It helps to identify high-growth prospects by categorizing the company’s product according to the growth rate and market share i.e. (it helps the organization to decide how to allocate the resources for the product or service it sells depending upon the position of the product or service in the market).It is mainly used by the people responsible for brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis.
      - The Boston matrix[1] includes two axis (market share and market growth) that split between high and low. It forms a 2x2 matrix which consists of 4 cells in which each cell is allocated to a category. Categories in the Boston matrix are 
•	Question marks
•	Stars
•	Cash cows
•	Dogs

    <pre> Market Growth		               	Market Share			Category
             High			     		Low		     Question marks
             High			    		High			  Stars
             Low				      	High			Cash Cows
             Low				      	Low		           Dogs
      </pre>
     - Based on the market share and market growth, products are placed among the four categories. Most organizations expect that their product life cycle starts from the question mark. Some products also begin from the star category. As the market keeps on growing the product, also changes from the question mark to star and then to cash cow and it finally enters into the dogs category when the market for the product is declined.
     - Question marks:
       - It is also known as the problem child. It has a low market share in the fast growing market. The revenue obtained from this category is very less and it is not enough to keep up with the rapid growth which in turn needs to invest more money to gain the market share. This category consumes more money.
Identifying the question marks with the potential to gain market share from all of them are very difficult. Careful analysis should be taken during identifying the question marks and investment should be spent on these question marks which replaces the existing market in the future. These question marks with stable market share are moved into the star. The question marks without stable market share even after investing on them lead to the dogs.
     - Stars: 
       - It has high market growth and high market share. The revenue obtained in this almost equal or high than the invested amount. Products with highest market share are moved into the cash cows when the market reaches its maturity level. The remaining products that are not capable to build market share move into Dogs category.
     - Cash cows: 
       - These are the low growth products with high market share. Successful products in mature markets are known as cows. These products are managed to earn the profits. The earnings obtained in this category are more than the invested amount. These investments should be utilized either in star or in the question marks category which builds the question marks into leaders. 
     - Dogs: 
       - This category is considered as the end of the product life cycle where it can be terminated if market declines or continued based on the situation. It belongs to low market share and low market growth. The revenue obtained from these is very less and just enough to keep its low market share. According to the organizational perspective spending resources for this category is a waste they can be used either in the question marks or in the star. Management needs to judge whether to continue or withdraw the product in/from the market.
    - Advantages:	
•	Provides a base for the management to decide and prepare for future actions.<br>
•	It is very simple to use, as there are only two dimensions and four quadrants.
    - Disadvantages:<br>
•	It splits the businesses two parts namely high and low. But whereas businesses can be medium also. Thus the true nature of the business does not reflected.<br>
•	At times, dogs may help other businesses in gaining competitive advantage. They can earn even more than cash cows sometimes.

    - <h5>A Case Study Evaluation of the Guideline-Supported QUPER Model for Elicitation of Quality Requirements</h5>
      -  Release planning is very important for market-driven software product developing organizations operating on a competitive open market. Product releases should be planned as early as possible to obtain the advantage of MDRE process with more quality level. Quality requirements play a major role for gaining success in the competitive market by overcoming competitors’ products. Hence, quality requirements can be considered to be a key competitive advantage. The main aim for developing QUPER model is to support high-level decision making in release planning of quality requirements. Release planning is defined as a process of deciding which requirements and quality level should be taken into account in each release.
      -  The main challenging task for the organizations developing software products is to set the right quality target in relation to future market demands and competitor products. Several methods and approaches like Release planning prototype and EVOLVE exist for supporting release planning. The main problem with these techniques is they use genetic algorithms for resolving release planning issues, which is a problem if the input data to the process is uncertain. None of the methods considered Quality requirements for release planning. Only two methods address quality constraints for release planning. They are 
        -  Win-Win model, focused on effort and time constraints.
        -  QUPER model is the only model to address the cost and quality constraints of Quality requirements.
      -  The need for handling the quality requirements and developing the model for supporting was identified during an investigation of cross-company requirements engineering process. Two main factors for the creation and evolvement of QUPER model are as follows
        -  Need for industry
        -  There is no suitable model for supporting the Quality requirements.
      -  The authors of this article mainly focused on 
        -  Guidelines of how to apply QUPER model in practice, with an illustration of Quality requirements.
        -  Incorporating cost dependencies between quality requirements.
        -  Two new evaluations of the complete version of quality requirements which help in finding the QUPER's applicability.
      -  Detailed guidelines for application of QUPER model is presented in 7 steps by considering an example of quality requirements. They are 
      -  Identify candidate quality requirements: It is important to consider the relevant features, market, competitor, and hardware platform capability when defining quality requirements.
      -  Define scale and unit: The quality level is identified with the help of scale and unit.
      -  Identify reference levels: Identify reference levels based on actual products and competing products. Estimations are considered based on the uncertainty level.
      -  Elicit quality breakpoints: For each quality requirement, market expectations should be defined as the values of quality breakpoints.
        -  Utility breakpoint which is the lowest acceptable value in the market 
        -  Saturation breakpoint, representing quality levels that are clearly considered excessive by the market. 
        -  Differentiation breakpoint, values above this breakpoint give a market advantage.
      -  Estimate cost barriers: For each quality requirement, the cost factor is estimated in terms of values of cost barriers. The recommended number of cost barriers are two.
      -  Set candidate requirements: Candidate requirements should be identified and decided for coming releases. Estimates can be given in three forms. They are
        -  Both a good target and a stretch target.
        -  Stretch target, highest accepted value is specified.
        -  Good target, lowest accepted value is specified.
      -  Identify cost dependencies: The other quality requirements that need to be changed if the quality requirement is improved from one breakpoint to another. It is important to identify the cost dependencies. Two factors should be considered during the selection process.
        -  Identifying the list of quality requirements that are cheaper and easier to improve when the one quality requirement is improved.
        -  Identifying the list of quality requirements that are more difficult and expensive to improve when the one quality requirement is improved.
      -  An extra step is Identifying cost dependencies were included in this paper. Dependencies have an impact on the estimated cost of another quality requirement. The cost to improve the quality level for one QR may imply an improved level of quality for other QR. This may lead to a change of other QR cost barriers and which QR to select for the coming release. 
      -  Each of these steps is clearly explained with figures and thus, it helps to know the practical view of QUPER model. Also, the complete version of QUPER was evaluated in the industry at one case company with 24 industry professionals using real QR.

   
   
    - <h5> A Market-Driven Requirements Engineering Process: Results from an Industrial Process Improvement Programme</h5>
      - The authors of this paper describe a specific industrial RE process for packaged software, called REPEAT. 
When developing packaged software for a marketplace, the RE process should be able to come up with requirements based on the foreseen end-user needs and select a set of requirements resulting in a software product which can compete on the market. REPEAT model can be used, for managing the continuous requirements.
      - REPEAT is a RE process that manages requirements throughout a whole release cycle. This model mainly concentrated on the RE activities such as elicitation, documentation, and validation. It also focuses on the requirements selection and release planning. The actors involved in the REPEAT model are:
        - Requirements Management Group (RQMG): mainly responsible for the requirements management and change management.
        - Issuer: mainly responsible for creating an issue based on the market needs and user demands.
        - Customers and users: responsible for providing input and feedback to a user
        - Requirements team: mainly responsible for analyzing and specifying a set of requirements.
        - Construction team: responsible for designing and implementing a set of requirements.
        - Test team: responsible for verifying the set of requirements.
        - Expert: responsible for identifying the cost and impact for the requirement.
        - Requirements Database (RQDB): a place where all the requirements are stored.
      - As in the MDRE process, a continuous flow of requirements is received. These received requirements are stored in the RQDB with a unique identity for each requirement. Each unique requirement has a life cycle progressing through several states. The RQMG group along with the support of experts is responsible for deciding on requirement state transitions. The states are
        - New: the requirement is issued and priority is given.
        - Assigned: requirement is assigned to an expert for classification
        - Classified: rough estimates of cost and impact are performed.
        - Selected: requirements selected for implementation.
        - Rejected: .requirements are rejected
        - Applied: requirements are implemented and verified.
      - REPEAT is instantiated for each release, and each process instance has a fixed duration of 14 months. A new product is released after every six months. REPEAT instance composes of five different phases, separated by milestones at predefined dates.  The phases are:
      - Elicitation Phase: 
        - It involves two activities collection and classification. The collection of requirements is done by an issuer and entered into the database along with the initial priority value. The RQMG group checks whether the requirements are clear or not. If requirements are clear then it is assigned to an expert where the cost and impact analysis is done for the requirement. Once the cost, impact, and priority values is assigned then requirement enters the classified state.
      - Selection phase:
        - This phase mainly concentrated on
          - Which requirements to be implemented in the current release 
          - Detailed information for selected requirement
          - Validate the requirement document
        - The output of this phase is a requirements document which includes a list of the selected requirements, detailed specification of all the selected requirements and non-selected requirements. The effort estimations and detailed specification for the selected requirements are done by the requirements group. The sorting of selected requirements in priority order is achieved by the requirements team and RQMG. After the completion of a Requirements document, it is validated before it is placed in the specification baseline.
      - Change management, Construction, Verification, and Conclusion: 
        - During change management, the RQMG takes decisions on changing the requirements caused by new incoming requirements. If the change of a requirement is approved then it is added to the selected list with a priority value. Feedback is given to the issuer on the decisions taken to the change request. Construction involves designing and implementation process along with unit testing. In the verification process, implemented requirements from the selected list are verified against the requirements document.  The conclusion phase involves the metric collection and a final report is documented which involves all the lessons learned from the REPEAT.
      - Some of the challenges that are faced in the REPEAT process are 
        - Overload control: As the requirements are increasing, the number of classified requirements in RQDB is increasing for every release which leads to overload of RQDB.
        - Connecting fragments: Requirement entities are not related to each other. There is a need to identify the requirements dependencies which is an important factor during the prioritization process.  
        - Bridging the chasm between elicitation and selection: the requirements fragments are described at very different levels of abstraction and classification gets difficult.
        - Long term product strategy for a diversity of market segments: the need of promoting activities related to the existing long-term product strategy and prioritization in relation to a range of market segments.
      - All these observed challenges were overcome in the REPEAT 2 model which involves hierarchical use case modelling and cost-value use case prioritization. Instead of depending on the expert judgement, REPEAT 2 model groups the requirements based on the use cases to which they are related, combined with a systematic cost-value prioritization approach.
      
      
      
    - <h5>Introducing Support for Release Planning of Quality Requirements – An Industrial Evaluation of the QUPER Model</h5>
      - The market-driven product development and release planning are becoming more common in the software industry. Release planning involves the selection of what features and requirements should be in a certain release, when it should be released and at what cost. Release planning is very crucial for the success of a product in the competitive market. Lacking of good release planning leads to unsatisfied customers and market loss.
      - In the competitive market, products with high-quality level dominate all the remaining competitors’ products. These quality requirements play an important part in the market-driven requirements engineering. When dealing with quality attributes like performance, usability and reliability, often fall into a difficult trade-off analysis. Along with that aspects like release targets, end-user experience and business opportunities must be taken into account.   
      - To support release planning and road mapping of quality requirements, a quality performance model was utilized (QUPER model). The authors of this paper mainly focused on the industrial evaluation of the QUPER model.  The quality performance model is a feature prioritization which includes quality as a dimension along with the two dimensions cost and value that are used for the prioritization of functional requirements. This model supports the prioritization and roadmapping of quality requirements at early stages of release planning, where high-level scoping decisions and roadmaps are created. The quality model was developed in three steps  mainly
        - Problem definition: To understand different requirement decision and the need for the cost-benefit model including quality aspects to support roadmapping and scoping was identified.
        - Model definition: It mainly comprises of three views mainly
          - Benefit view: It includes breakpoints indicating principal changes in the benefit level with respect to user experience and market value. There are three breakpoints in this view. A breakpoint is identified as a non-linear relation between quality and benefit.
            - Utility break point: It is defined as a border between useless quality and useful quality.
            - Differentiation breakpoint: It is defined as a border between a useful quality to competitive quality.
            - Saturation breakpoint: It is defined as the change in the quality level from competitive to excessive quality. There is no impact on the benefit after reaching to higher quality levels.
          - Cost view: It includes the notation of cost barriers that represent the non-linear relation between quality and costs.
          - Roadmap view: It combines the cost and benefit views by positioning the breakpoints and barrier together ordered on the same scale. This enables the visualization of benefit breakpoints and cost barriers with respect to the quality levels of the current and competing products.
        - Model validation: An evaluation of the model is carried out through interviews with experts.
      - This model is evaluated at Sony Ericsson. It only includes benefit view because it is an important factor to consider in QUPER model. The following four steps describe how the QUPER benefit view is implemented at Sony
        - Quality aspects identifying 
        - Estimating the products current quality and competing for product quality
        - Estimating the breakpoints for each quality attribute 
        - Estimating candidate targets, discussing and deciding the actual targets for coming releases.
      - The authors of this have tailored, implemented and evaluated the QUPER model on real projects using real requirements at Sony Ericssion. The results obtained were positive, it is relevant in high-level decision-making for quality requirements during release planning. The evaluation results show that this model is easy to understand and learn, straight forward and not complicated to apply. The challenges addressed during the evaluation of QUPER model were identifying and defining the values for breakpoints.


    - <h5> The Art and Science of Software Release Planning</h5>
      - This paper mainly concentrated on the importance of release planning. Release planning address the decisions related to selecting and assigning features to create a sequence of consecutive product releases that satisfies important technical, resource, budget and risk factors. A good release plan should 
        - Satisfy the involved stakeholders.
        - Feasible with available resources
        - Dependencies between the features should be reflected
        - Maximum benefit values by delivering the best features in a right sequences of deliveries.
      - The authors of this paper presented two approaches to release planning. They are 
        - The art of RP approach: relies on the human intuition, communication, and capabilities which can address RP’s implicit and tactical aspects. This approach is used in many agile practices, it includes physical meetings between different stakeholders and relies on their effort. This approach fails, when the number of features and stakeholders is high. It doesn’t provide any guidance on how to decide features and priorities in the case of involvement of multiple stakeholders and techniques to solve the conflicts that arise between multiple stakeholders.
        - The science of RP approach: This is a formal approach which is based on the belief that the problem can be formalized and results can be obtained by solving it.
      - The formalization of RP aspects using ad-hoc methods include incremental funding method and penny’s maintenance planning. These approaches fail to address the factors that impact release planning.The art-based approach faces trouble with the RP problem’s complexity as the number of factors grows. This complex problem can be overcome by the Science-based approach. The science-based approach fails to evaluate the problem similar to humans. Both these approaches have their own disadvantages. To overcome this problem, a new approach i.e. Hybrid approach is developed.
      - This approach combines both art and science in a high-level framework that stresses the continuous process needed to perform the release planning and replanning. This approach is developed further and consists of three phases of the planning process. They are         - Modelling: It mainly concentrates on the description of the dynamic real world to make it suitable for computational-intelligence-based solution techniques. This includes three tasks they are
          - Plan objectives and constraints: It involves formalizing the objective function.
          - Offer stakeholder voting: These are the people directly or indirectly affected by the release planning.
          - Estimate resources: Estimates of various resources are implemented to each feature.
	 - Exploration: In this phase, basing on the formal model a solution plan is generated.
	 - Consolidation: In this phase, based on the experience and the problem context the decision makers evaluate the computational algorithm’s solution. 
       - The proposed approach is also implemented, a trial project encompasses 15 features to include in the next two releases. The reasons for developing and it also promises to carry release planning state to a higher level are because of:
        - The need for sophisticated methodology
        - Letting organizations to plan easily by introducing formalism.
        - Along with values of features, impact criteria should also consider.
        - Formally generated release plans should be evaluated easily by humans.

    
    
    
  - <h5> Seminar 1</h5>
    - <h5>A method for early requirements triage and selection utilizing product strategies</h5>
      - The authors of this paper evaluate an efficient and effective method that deals with the challenge of an overload of the development organization due to a large number of requirements in the case of market-driven product development. In market-driven requirements engineering, requirements come from internal sources and also from external sources which result in large and continuous flow of requirements. All these issued requirements are stored in the repositories. Continuous requirements lead to the overload of repositories in the development organizations. It is difficult for the product management to select the requirements that are aligned with the products strategy by removing the requirements that are not suitable or ambiguous and uncertain. Strategy formulation is an important factor and factors affecting it vary among stakeholders. Strategic and middle management and technical experts all need to share one vision. This can be accomplished by a method for Early Requirement Triage and selection (MERTS) which consists of both strategic and technical perspectives to formulate the product strategies. 
      - The main reason for using MERTS is to provide a clear view for achieving consensus and for understanding the product strategy. The main purpose of MERTS is
        - It acts as a stepwise guide for creating product strategies that consider both technical and strategic views.
        - Strategies resulting from MERTS can be used by project managers to efficiently perform requirement triage and requirement selection in a reasonable amount of time.
      - A method for early Requirements Triage utility product strategies (MERTS) is built based on the needs identified in literature and industry. MERTS is centered on ensuring that the five strategic questions for a product are answered explicitly. The project managers using this method should follow three parts and each part has several steps.
        - Early requirement Triage: Some steps are provided to create an initial product strategy for use in requirement triage.
          - Specify: It concentrates on specifying the directions of movement for the product deduced from the organizations’ mission statement. It includes answers for three strategic questions Where we want to go? , How to get there? , and What will be done?. These questions help in understanding the goals and objectives associated with a specific product.
          - Assign weights: The weights are assigned to the each answer obtained from the step 1. The weights are allocated to each based on their relative importance. 
          - Compare requirements: Total weights of all requirements obtained from step 2 are compared against a threshold to select or reject each of the requirements.
        - Requirements selection for release: After the identification of a set of requirements, the next step is when to get there. This can be done through two steps 
          - Specification of product technology roadmap: It provides a clear view of the relationship between product releases and technology generation.
          - Estimating resources: In order to determine the feasibility and organization need, the effort estimates are calculated and plotted in the road map.
        - Strategic Rationale: Once the strategic questions have been answered, the reasoning behind the decisions should be reported.
      - The validation of this method MERTS was performed in the industry. It mainly concentrated on the aspects usability and usefulness of the MERTS method and the obtained results are positive.

    
    - <h5>Requirements engineering: In search of the dependent variables</h5>
      - When software development teams modify their requirements engineering process as an independent variable, the change in the process can be assessed by examining the quality of the products requirements engineering process. The authors of this paper present a framework of dependent variables. Organizations are seeking to improve their requirements engineering process. The results in change of process can be assessed using two ways they are
        - Requirements process: It is a measurement of time and consumed.
        - Primary product: It is the measurement of the quality of the software product.
      - Processes that are changed called independent variables and the outcomes that are observed due to these changes are dependent variables. As they change tremendously from shortest term to longest term. Deciding the right dependent variable for any case is non-trivial. So, the authors of this paper present a framework of dependent variables. Consists of five levels. Each level can serve as a basis for quality assessment in requirements engineering. The impact on the dependent variables can be assessed when the requirements process changes. These dependent variables have five distinct levels they are 
        - Requirements phase: This level determines the level of Requirements specification. This level includes the dependent variables related to 
          - Requirements cost and time:It includes total cost of requirement effort,total duration used for development.
          - Requirements quality: It includes the quality of the requirements specification.
        - Project: This level determines the degree of project’s success. It also includes the dependent variables related to 
          - Project cost and time: it considers the total project duration and cost.
          - Project estimates: It is defined as the degree of meeting the budget, schedule, and as specified requirements.
          - Degree of requirements change: It includes the change in the process of requirements.
        - Product: This level determines the degree of product success. It also includes the dependent variables related to
          - Requirements selection: It is defined as the degree to which the selected requirements reduce errors and increases the efficiency of the product. 
          - Degree of impact: It is defined as the degree to which the product increases the revenue, decrease costs for the company developing the product.
        - Company: This level describes whether the company was successful or not. It includes some of the measures like
          - Portfolio management: It is defined as the degree to which products compliment each other and demonstrate the use of resources.
          - Strategic alignment: It is defined as the degree to which product align with the strategies.
          - Degree of impact: The factors like profits, profit growth, market share, and return on investment are examined in this area.
        - Society: The project that contributes to a company’s bottom line and pollutes the environment or kills people must be considered as the failure. In society level, products give rise to positive and negative externalities.
      - A detailed summary of previous research on measures of all the five levels by which this article acts as a reference for research performed in this area. The contributions of this paper include
        - The influence of RE process can be assessed by creating the taxonomy levels.
        - The impacts are multidisciplinary and multi-perspective at higher levels in the taxonomy.
        - Strategies should be performed explicitly and the individuals performing RE process should be aware.
        - Product strategies should reflect long-term goals by aligning to both current market and technology trends.
        - The assessment of RE process change is very difficult from a wider perspective.
      - All the engineers, managers and marketing personnel develop and share responsibility for monitoring dependent variables. They identified that change in the process affects more than one quality level. It is very important to identify the importance of dependent variables among different levels 

    
    - <h5>A Cost–Value Approach for Prioritizing Requirements</h5>
      - Developing software systems that meet stakeholder’s needs and expectations is the ultimate goal of any software provider seeking a competitive edge. For achieving this stakeholder’s requirements: the features, functions, and the attributes should be managed effectively and accurately in the software system. In the real word software development, the number of incoming requirements will be more than the number of requirements selected for implementation. It is very difficult on deciding which requirements are really mattered and one increasingly demanded because of time and budget constraints. The managers still don’t have simple, effective and industrial proven techniques for prioritizing the requirements.  Considered this scenario as a gap and the authors of this paper developed an analytical tool for prioritizing the requirements based on a cost-value approach.
      - Clear and unambiguous knowledge about the prioritization of requirements helps the companies to manage the projects effectively and efficiently. It can also help in 
        - Make acceptable tradeoffs among conflicting goals such as cost, quality, and time-to-market.
        - Allocating resources based on the projects based on the requirements importance
      - When the time-to-market is very important, it is very to know how to rank the requirements which help in planning releases by indicating which functions are critical and which can be added over successive releases. 
      - The cost-value approach is a process for prioritizing the software requirements.  Some of the properties that an approach should hold are as follows:
        - It should be simple and fast at the same time it should generate accurate and trustworthy results.
        - It also must hold the stakeholders satisfaction as both the ultimate goal and the guiding theme. Stakeholder’s satisfaction contains three factors namely quality, cost, and delivery.
        - For a software system to succeed, quality must be maximized, cost minimized and time-to-delivery will be as short as possible. 
      - In the cost-value approach, the candidate requirements are ranked by considering two dimensions they are 
        - According to their value to customer and users 
        - According to their estimated cost of implementation.
      - These costs are calculated in terms of money by the developers. It is found that the prioritizing the requirements based on relative rather than the absolute assignments is faster, more accurate and more trustworthy. To achieve this, an Analytical hierarchy process is used.
      - Analytical Hierarchy process compares requirements pairwise according to their relative value and cost. This pairwise comparison approach includes much redundancy and less sensitive to judgmental errors common to techniques using absolute assignments.
There are five steps for prioritizing the requirements using cost-value approach. They are
        - Candidate requirements should be carefully reviewed by requirement engineers to ensure that the requirements are unambiguous.
        - Customers and users apply the AHP’s pairwise comparison to achieve the relative value of the candidate requirement.
        - AHP’s pairwise comparison should be used by experienced software developers for finding the relative cost for implementing the candidate’s requirement.
        - A software engineer uses AHP to calculate each candidate’s requirement’s relative value and implementation cost, and plot theses on a cost-value diagram.
        - This diagram will act as a conceptual map for analyzing and discussing the candidate requirement by the stakeholders.
      - The software managers prioritize the requirements and decide which will be implemented and also used for developing the strategies for release planning. This technique has been applied in two commercial telecommunications software development systems. These two projects clearly describe how well the requirements are prioritized based on the cost-value approach and the implementation of analytical hierarchy process for pair comparison and the process that is carried out in the cost-value approach is clearly described.The main problem with this approach, more requirements will also raise the problem of complexity, since the number of pairwise comparisons.
 

  - <h5> Seminar 2</h5>
     - <h5>Towards a Reference Framework for Software Product Management</h5>
       - The authors of this article mainly focused on developing a reference framework which provides a structure for a body of knowledge for software product management. A clear explanation of how a software product management process is carried out entirely by an organization and the structure of the software product management is not provided clearly. The authors of this article considered this as a gap and developed a reference framework based on an overview of state-of-the-art literature and industrial case studies. This framework clearly explains the step by step process that is carried out by the product managers/organization during the software product management. It also helps in identifying the stakeholders for the company/product and their relation during software product management. 
       - This reference framework divides the software product management into four process area mainly
       	 - Portfolio management: It deals with the products in the product portfolio (no of products a company has).
       	 - Product road mapping: It is used to identify the different releases of a product
       	 - Requirements management: It deals with the content of each individual requirement.
       	 - Product release planning: It deals with the set of requirements that are to be released.
       - In the reference framework, these four processes are carried out as follows:
       - Portfolio management process involves four tasks
         - Partnering and contracting
         - Market trend identification
         - Product life cycle management
         - Product line identification
	 - The input to this process is available from the board, market and partner companies. These inputs help in making the decision about the development strategy and lifecycle. A software product line is identified in this process which serves as an input for product road mapping.
       - Product road mapping process involves these tasks
         - Theme identification
         - Core asset identification
         - Road map construction
         - This process receives input as product lines from portfolio management. This helps in identifying the themes and core assets. This information is collected and mentioned in the road map. This roadmap also acts as an input to the requirements organization.
       - Requirements management process involves these three tasks
         - Requirements gathering
         - Requirements identification
         - Requirements organizing.
         - In this process, input (requirements) obtained from different stakeholders are gathered and identified. Finally, the product requirements are grouped according to the product and core asset.
       - Product release planning mainly involves these five tasks.
         - Requirements prioritization
         - Requirements selection
         - Release definition
         - Release verification
         - Launch application
         - It takes input from the requirements management process where the obtained list of requirements is prioritized and some are selected from the prioritized requirements. A release definition is prepared for the selected requirements and validated by different internal stakeholders and a business case is sent to the board for approval. Once approval is received the implementation process starts and the launch preparation package is delivered to the stakeholders.
       - As this framework also helps in identifying the stakeholders. Some of the stakeholders that are identified and mentioned in this framework are
        - External Stakeholders
           - Market
           - Partner companies
           - Customers
        - Internal stakeholders
           - Development
           - Support
           - Service
           - Research and innovation
           - Sales and marketing
           - Company board
       - This article provides me a clear information and structure of the software product management. The internal processes that are carried out during the software product development and the tasks that are involved in the each process (Road mapping, release planning, requirements management, portfolio management) are clearly understood.
      


  - <h5> Market-Driven Requirements Engineering for Software Products</h5>
    - This paper mainly addresses the challenges that are faced in the MDRE, roadmapping, release planning, MDRE management and MDRE process.
    - Developing a software product to an open market rather than to one specific customer. This type of software development is termed as market-driven requirement engineering. The main objectives of the MDRE is to deliver the right product at right time. The development costs of a product are divided among many buyers on an open market and profit is rewarded to the producer. MDRE covers the requirements engineering activities such as elicitation, validation, and specification. It also covers the activities like release management and market analysis which are important in the MDRE. It mainly focuses on the prioritization, cost estimation, and release planning which are conducted by the organization. Some of the most important characteristics of MDRE context are:
      - Along with all the decisions, the developing organization will also take risks.
      - The continuous flow of requirements throughout the product lifecycle.
      - Incoming requirements are growing and their volume is large.
      - The majority of the requirements are described informally
      - Evolving continuously and delivered in multiple releases.
      - Release planning focuses on the time-to-market and return-on-investment.
    - The RE challenges that are faced in the market-driven software development are 
      - Balancing the market pull and technology push: Finding a balance between technology driven and market driven.
      - Chasm between marketing and development: the gap between marketing and development team leads to the different views on RE.
      - Organizational instability and market turbulence: companies without defined process takes a significant risk when a person leaves the organization.
      - Simple tools for basic needs: companies requested to use simple and easy to use techniques.
      - Requirements dependencies: the presence of dependencies make the release planning difficult.
      - Cost-value estimation and release planning: It requires accurate estimations, whereas inaccurate estimations lead to the cause of delay in deadline and rise of cost.
      - Overloaded requirements management: It is a challenge to prevent the requirements repository from being flooded.
    - The key factor for a market driven company is to continuously improve in managing these challenges in such a way that it stays ahead of competitors.
    - When designing a MDRE process for a specific company, there are many situational factors that need to be considered for the process implementation. The factors are 
      - Development process type
      - Distribution channels type
      - Market type
      - Product complexity
      - Nature of competition 
      - Customer behavior
      - User interface complexity
      - Prediction on sales
      - Product flexibility and adaptability
    - During the design of MDRE process, it is important to determine the criteria for the success and the notation of process quality. The major problem related to the process quality is the quality of decision made about produced artefacts. It can be captured by referring to the ratio of correct decision that are made during release planning as in alfa/beta model. An alfa requirement is defined as a requirement with high quality that it is ideally selected. These are also named as golden grains among all candidates. Beta requirements are defined as the requirements that should be rejected because of its low quality.
    - The main challenge in MDRE process is to find and select the alfa requirements and reject beta requirements. It is also not easy to know which requirement is alfa/ beta as the cost-benefit tradeoff is very difficult. A cost-value diagram is plotted for alfa and beta requirements. The value and cost of a requirement is not only depend on itself but also on the other requirements. In MDRE process, there is a chance of getting into congestion.
    - In MDRE data management, mainly contains two ingredients
      - Requirements state model: It is used for progress tracking of requirements refinement.Requirements are received at any time, but the development of the product is made in releases. There are two modes
        - Continuous mode: in this requirements are received from all types of submitters and registered by the product manager.
        - Release mode: The development and requirement activities are carried out in this mode
        - During this process, from the initial stage to final stage requirements undergoes several transitions they are as follows:
        - Candidate: The received requirement gets the status of the candidate.
        - Approved: At regular intervals of time, the requirements with candidate status are reviewed. If the requirements are accepted then it is changed to accepted status.
        - Specified: When the specification document is available then it gets a status specified.
        - Discarded: rejected requirements gets the status of discarded.
        - Planned: The planned release date and the available resources determine the number of days available for the development, testing, and product completion. All the planned requirements are input for design and development.
        - Developed: when all the activities are implemented successfully then the requirements get the status developed.
        - Verified: Several testing activities are done for the developed system. If the results obtained are positive then it gets a status of positive.
        - Released: when all the activities of the product release are completed then the requirement finally gets a status of released.
      - Requirements repository: relevant attributes and candidate requirements are stored.
    - Roadmap and release planning are one of the important factors to be considered in the MDRE context. The roadmap is defined as a document that provides a layout of the product releases to come over a time frame of three to five years. A taxonomy was established which creates roadmaps according to their locations. This taxonomy scheme classifies roadmaps broadly into four categories they are:
      - Science and technology roadmaps
      - Industry technology roadmaps’
      - Corporate or product technology roadmaps
      - Product or portfolio management roadmaps
    - The roadmap helps in identifying the objects and helps to focus the required resources in achieving those objectives. The roadmap has several potential benefits at both corporate and industry levels. Th major uses of roadmap are 
      - To plan and coordinate the development activities that are carried out in an industry
      - Mechanism to help experts forecast technology development in target areas.
      - Development of consequences about a set of needs and the technologies.
    - A product roadmap in MDRE context contains four layered structure from strategy making to the development of the software product. At first, the investment plan is calculated based on the revenues and forecast plans of product lines. The investment plan is an input for the management of the product development unit to create a product roadmap. Product managers are responsible in the next layer i.e. release process. It mainly concentrates on the set of requirements for various releases. The set of product requirements are then taken as input for the development process and the results are inserted into the kernel where the software is build. The software builds together with auxiliary materials and manuals is then packaged as a new release.In MDRE context, there are so many challenges observed in the areas like prioritization, management of dependencies and tool support for handling large scale requirements.



       
  - <h5> Exploring factors affecting decision outcome and lead time in large scale requirements engineering</h5>
    - In MDRE process, the product has to be aligned with the targeted market needs to create a profitable software product. In MDRE projects, requirements keep on coming, deciding which requirements to be implemented is far from trivial. Customer needs keep evolving and cause changes to requirements. Analyzing and deciding upon these changes are critical for staying competitive in the market. 
    - It is very difficult to select which change requirements should be accepeted. To effectively improve the RE decision-making more effort should be dedicated towards decision-making aspect. It is very important to identify the factors that affect the decision lead time and the decision outcome. Some of the characteristics of change requests that are identified 
      - No of products: It is considered as the no of products affected by the decision. Termed as a proxy for decision complexity.
      - Release number: the specific number of the release affected by the change request. The higher the release number, the later the release in the release cycle.
      - Type of customer: a request is filed by an important external attribute or is internally generated.
    - The decision lead time is defined as the duration between the moment a request was filed and the moment the change control board decision was made. The decision-making is an important part of requirements engineering and impacts requirement management. RE decision-makers have to deal with the difficulties such as ill-defined or competing goals and values, powers and politics also influence the decision-making process. Along with these some of the challenges in the requirements engineering decision-making process are 
      - Uncertain environments
      - Action and feedback loop
      - Time stress
      - Multiple Stakeholder situations
      - Organizational goals
      - Uncertain estimates
      - Incompleteness of available information
      - Maturity of the product
    - The marketplace, the tools, methods, and technologies used by the organization also influence the decision-making process. As a result, the risk of making wrong decisions is more and consequences faced will be serious. To improve this process, understanding the nature of decisions made in the RE is important.
    - The project decision makers consider both the requirements internally and externally generated. Change requests to these requirements are constantly submitted by the stakeholders. One feature can receive several change requests of various importance and scope from small changes to requests for complete feature removal. The change control system is used in order to capture, track and assess the impact of changes. CCB contains product and project managers, projects stakeholders and a champion who is responsible for leading the CCB meetings. The role of CCB is to decide upon adding or removing features according to the issued change requests. These change requests are high-level requests at the feature level regarding new functionality after a change request is filed. The request is put on the quality gateway model for analysis. Later an impact analysis is carried out which identifies both the requirements that are directly affected and dependent and the potential costs of change are assessed. After impact analysis, the request is submitted at the weekly CCB meeting, where change proposals are reviewed one by one which also involves discussions and clarifications. If the analysis performed by the group is not satisfied, extra information can be requested before the final decision is taken. Finally, if the request is accepted that change is implemented.
    - The authors of this mainly concentrated on identifying the characteristics of a decision affect the decision lead time, decision outcome and decision lead time have any impact on the decision outcome. They conducted both survey and case study, the results were not same in both the cases.
    - In both the cases, these are satisfied
      - The lead time makes a decision increases when more products are influenced by this decision. 
      - Change requests issued by important customers are more likely to be accepted.
    - There is contradiction between the results obtained from survey and case study, for the release of product line has any impact on the lead time, the customer type has any impact on the lead time, no of products affected has any impact on the decision outcome, release number has any impact on the decision outcome and finally, thus lead time affects the decision outcome. These are not clear research should be in this area to get a clear idea regarding the decision-making process.
    - Some of these points are observed during their investigation about the lead time and decision-making. They are
      - In VLSRE, less complex decisions are more rejected. In smaller contexts, they are more likely accepted.
      - In VLSRE, change of accepting a request is higher if that request affects a late release. In smaller these late requests are rejected.
      - In VLSRE, decision-making is not faster for important customers. In smaller contexts important customers receive faster responses.
      


  - <h5>An Industrial Survey of Requirements Interdependencies in Software Product Release Planning</h5>
   - The authors of this paper mainly concentrated on identifying the nature and frequency of requirements interdependencies and their importance in software release planning. As the incremental development strategies become a common place in the industry, incremental planning gains both importance and interest. The task of finding an optimal selection of requirements for the next release of the software system is difficult as requirements may depend on each other in complex ways. The authors of this paper conducted an informal survey and identified six different planning parameters that need to be considered and satisfied for release planning they are
     - Available resources
     - Delivery time
     - Requirements interdependencies
     - Requirements priority
     - System architecture and
     - Dependencies to code base
   - Requirements prioritization is an important task in the incremental planning. Because of the interdependencies between requirements, it is impossible or difficult to schedule the requirements based on priority. Requirement interdependencies play a critical role during release planning. The main aim of this article is to identify the nature and the frequency of the requirements interdependencies. For gaining knowledge about the requirements interdependencies, the authors of this paper conducted a survey among 5 companies. Among five cases, three of the companies come under market-driven where it has a mature product in the market. Remaining two cases come under bespoke, meaning that there was no released version of the product on the market and there was only one specific customer paying for the development. In these five cases, the requirements managers are requested to consider top twenty requirements from the repositories of their current projects. They are requested to prioritize the requirements without considering the interdependencies among each other and pairwise considerations are done for all the 20 requirements. There are no of possibilities for each pair combination. They are as follows
     - No relation between the requirements. The research managers are asked to rate the level of certainty on the scale(Possibly, Probably, Positively) 
     - The relation between the requirements is found. The relation between the requirements is identified using a classification schema and along with that level of uncertainty is mentioned.
   - A preliminary set of interdependency types were created (Classification schema). It has six different types of interdependencies they are
     - AND
     - REQUIRES
     - TEMPORAL
     - CVALUE
     - ICOST
     - OR
   - Functional interdependencies should have higher priority than the value related interdependencies. The priority order among the interdependencies types is as follows
     - AND has the highest priority
     - REQUIRES has the second priority
     - TEMPORAL can be either functional related or value related. It can be either REQUIRES or ICOST. The priority order is next to the REQUIRES.
     - ICOST and CVALUE come under the same priority. As both of them are value related dependencies. If a conflict arises between these two then a trade-off should be considered. The CVALUE interdependency type plays a major role in the release planning.
     - OR comes under all the interdependency types and it has the least priority. 
   - Finally, a data visualization approach is applied for managing the requirements interdependencies. In this approach, the requirements and their interdependencies are represented by using objects and arrows in a traditional way to draw important conclusions associated with release planning. This helps in identifying the flow of a process between the requirements. This paper also concentrates on identifying the requirement dependencies with less effort. First of all, singular requirements, i. e., requirements having no relationship with any other requirements, are easily identified which can be released in any increment. Later the requirements having relationships to many other requirements are further identified and released as early as possible. Finally, free clusters of requirements can be planned for any increment, as long as all involved requirements are scheduled for the same increment. Requirements that are having many dependencies between them should be scheduled for the same release in order to simplify the realization. 
   - In order to support the release planning the concepts requirements coupling and release coupling are used. Requirements coupling is used to describe the complexity of the planning. Release coupling is used to specify the number of interdependencies between the partitions (releases). These two serve as an interdependency goodness measure in release planning. Finally, authors of this paper concluded that to minimize the efforts needed to identify and manage the requirements interdependencies it is important to find and refine the heuristics for the identification of singular requirements as well as highly dependent requirements and finally the free clusters.

  - <h5>Obsolete Software Requirements</h5> 
    - Software as a business is a demanding environment, where a growing number of users, rapid introduction of new technologies and fierce competition are inevitable. The major challenges in this environment are high volatility and quick evolution of requirements, requirements that often are more likely to become obsolete even before project completion.
    - In MDRE, the pace of incoming requirements and requirements change is high. Changes in the requirements make them become obsolete and these obsolete requirements can dramatically extend the timeline of the project and also leads to increase in the cost of the project. Software companies need to identify which requirements are obsolete or outdated. Identification and handling of obsolete requirements are important as large volumes of degrading requirements threaten the effective requirements management. 
    - Requirements management is an integral component of the requirements engineering. It mainly concentrates on managing the data created in the requirements elicitation and development phases. It integrates the data to the entire flow of the development life cycle. Any changes to the requirements should be managed effectively by the requirements manager during the product life cycle. The absence of requirements manager during this process lead to the cause of outdated requirements specifications as the information about changes to the original requirements is not fed back. Some of the reasons for the cause of obsolete software requirements are mentioned. They are 
     - Scope creep
     - Requirements creep
     - Requirements leakage
    - Along with these some of the reasons for obsolete requirements are postponing the implementation of planned functionality cause the requirements to become obsolete, longer it takes from defining requirements to implementation the higher the risk of change. The authors of this paper mainly concentrated on understanding the nature of obsolete requirements and their role in requirements management. They conducted a survey and investigated the phenomenon of obsolete requirements and effort required to handle the obsolete requirements in industrial practice. The authors of this paper found that 
     - The obsolete software requirements create serious impact in industry practice.
     - The type of requirement also plays an important role in becoming the requirement to obsolete requirement. Requirements related to laws, standards and given by experts were less likely to become obsolete. Inconsistent and ambiguous requirements, requirements from customers or internal developers were more likely to become obsolete
     - Obsolete software requirements should be identified through manual activity.
     - There is no specific process for dealing with requirements at the time of their identification. It completely depends upon the size of the project and the organization. They are stored in a requirements document or in a database with a tag as obsolete.
     - LSRE and VLSRE are likely to be affected by the obsolete software requirements. As the requirements are more issues related to obsolete requirements are more. When related to MDRE and bespoke, the projects related to MDRE are likely to be affected by the obsolete requirements.
     - These obsolete requirements should be handled in the requirements analysis and requirements validation process.
    - The process of identifying, handling and removal of obsolete requirements is crucial. The identified requirements are stored either in databases or in documents. These requirements are not deleted because they can be used for the purposes reference and traceability, which help in minimizing the repeated work.

    - <h5>Assessing challenges of continuous integration in the context of software requirements breakdown: a case study</h5>
      - The complexity of the software development has been increasing in recent few years. Now a days are demanding for the products with high quality and more stable product within short delivery. In order, to meet the challenges posed by the customers, software companies are trying to improve their process.  This can be observed to some extent by using agile development technology because they put a focus on the customer collaboration and loop feedback. Companies using agile strategies are now adopting to the continuous integration in order to achieve the complete benefits offered by this process. Continuous integration is defined as the concept where team integrates their code several times a day and then build and test the software. It is not an easy process for the organizations changing from their respective development process (traditional/agile) to continuous integration.
      - The authors of this paper mainly concentrated on identifying the challenges of continuous integration, requirements breakdown and how the latter implementation of the continuous integration process. A case study was carried out at Ericsson AB within the serving GPRS support node mobility management entity program. The teams working in this case study uses several branches for integration and development at different quality levels they are 
        - Work branch: when a new feature is developed.
        - Latest local version: tests that cover expected changes in functionality
        - Pre-Test build: full regression tests run in this branch
        - Latest stable version: complete system tests run on this branch.
      - During the case study at Ericsson, all the cross-functional teams integrated their codes among these branches according to their need. They identified several challenges during this study related to continuous integration process they are
      - The challenges that were identified for continuous integration are 
        - Mindset: mindset plays an important role when transitioning to continuous integration. The challenges that are identified related to mindset are 
          - Scepticism 
          - Change old habits
          - Exposing work intention
        - Tools & Infrastructure: The tools and infrastructure play an important role during continuous integration. Tools for reviewing code, visualizing regression testing results, running automated test suites, checking in code. Some of the problems that arise at the   time of using this tools and infrastructure are  
          - Code review
          - Maturity
          - Regression feedback time
          - Test automation
          - Integration queue.
        - Testing: Challenges associated with this is due to lack of automated tests along with a stable test framework. Some of the challenges related to testing are 
          - Unstable test cases
          - Too many manual tests
          - Implementation and test dependencies
          - Preserving quality
        - Domain applicability: It is defined as the suitability of continuous integration at the organization. The challenges that are identified because of domain applicability are
          - Process suitability
          - Product complexity
        - Understanding: Teams and management might interpret the concept of continuous integration differently. As a result, some challenges are being identified as follows:
          - Unclear goals
          - Increased pressure
          - Different interpretations
          - Bottom-up approach
        - Code dependencies: Development was carried out by several developers instead of one, because of diving work into several integrations. This shows the importance of considering code dependencies and how it effects the integration process and challenges are as follows:
          - Integration coordination
          - Dead code
        - Software requirements: When adopting continuous requirements they are treated as a challenge. The requirements need to be broken in order to allow more frequent integrations. How the software requirements affect the integration process is demonstrated by the challenges as mentioned:
          - Requirements breakdown
          - Deliver feature growth
          - Integration of big impact changes
      - The challenges that are identified because of requirements breakdown are:
        - Requirements abstraction: It is very difficult when the requirements are too big, ambiguous or too low. The challenges that are identified related to the requirements abstraction are:
          - Ambiguous requirements
          - Large requirements
          - Low-level requirements
          - Architectural design
          - Product complexity
        - Alignment of requirements and tests: when integrating requirements into the main line, they need to be associated with tests and aligned properly. The challenges identified related to alignment of requirements and test are 
          - Implementation and test case dependencies
        - Customer value: It is a very process for breaking down requirements into small components by considered the market and customer value. The challenges identified in this area are:
          - Access to customer
          - Delivering the customer value
        - Guiding principle: Lack of guidance and not having a clear idea on the unified process are identified as the possible reasons for this ambiguity. The challenges associated with this are due to
          - No unified process
          - Ongoing responsibility shift
          - Unfit process
          - Lack of guidance
      - The challenges that are identified because of requirements breakdown during continuous integration
        - Necessity of software requirements breakdown: In order to adopt an efficient continuous integration process with a beneficial integration frequency, there is a need for the breakdown of software requirements. The challenges that are identified because of this are 
          - Big impact requirements
          - Maintenance versus feature development
        - Implications of software requirements breakdown: The challenges identified relate to this area as follows:
          - Implementation dependencies
          - Integration scope
          - Test dependencies
          - On Demand Software Delivery
      - Role of software requirements breakdown plays an important role when adopting continuous integration, especially with regards to an increased integration frequency.
