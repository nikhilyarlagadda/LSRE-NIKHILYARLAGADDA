- <h5>Article 1: Requirements Abstraction Model</h5>
  - <h5> Method description</h5> 
    - The main aim of the RAM is to provide a requirement engineering model that helps professionals with product planning and development. It supports the continuous requirements engineering effort, aimed at taking the requirements at multiple levels as input and offers a structure for breaking down these requirements into detailed ones and vice versa by means of work-up. RAM model is implemented in three steps in requirements engineering
      - Specify: It involves specifying the initial requirement and eliciting enough information about it to specify a number of requirements. Four attributes are manually specified they are 
        - Description: It provides the central essence of the requirement.
        - Reason/Benefit/Rationale: It deals with why the requirement is specified and benefit of the requirement.
        - Risk/Restrictions: This attribute describes the restrictions and risks with the requirements.
        - Title: It reflects the contents of the requirement.
      - Place: It is centered around what abstraction level the now specified requirements reside on. It consists of four abstraction levels they are 
        - Product level: It is the most abstract level. In this requirements are considered abstract enough to be comparable directly to the product strategies.
        - Feature level: It is next level in the model. The requirements on this level are features that the product supports. 
        - Functional level: This requirement should be a descriptive of what a user should be able to perform. It mainly concentrates on the functional activities.
        - Component level: It is the last level in the model. These requirements are of a detailed nature depicting information in detail. These act as a possibility to breakdown functional level requirements into more detail and set the limits to functional level requirement.
      - Abstraction: It involves breakdown of requirement, depending on initial placement of original requirement. The work- process involves the creation of new requirements to the adjacent levels or linking the existing requirements. Two rules are used to do this work-process they are 
        - Rule 1 : NO requirement may exist without having a connection to the product level
        - Rule 2: All requirements have to be broken down to functional level.
      - If the requirements are not specified in the other levels then the additional requirements are specified in the abstraction levels until workup rule R1 and R2 satisfied. A how-to guide is also provided to help how to specify the requirements in the abstract level.
